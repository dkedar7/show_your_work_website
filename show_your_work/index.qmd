## Welcome to the Tutorial!

Transform your Python functions into interactive web applications and ensure your scientific work reaches the audience it deserves. In this hands-on session, you'll learn to bridge the gap between analysis and presentation using modern, open-source toolsâ€”all without leaving the Python ecosystem.

## What You'll Accomplish

By the end of this 4-hour tutorial, you will have:

- **Built and deployed** multiple interactive web applications
- **Created a personal portfolio** showcasing your work
- **Mastered the decision process** for choosing the right web framework
- **Gained practical experience** with cutting-edge Python tools
- **Developed reproducible workflows** you can apply to future projects

## Why This Matters

Excellent science hidden in code repositories has zero impact. Many brilliant researchers struggle to showcase their work effectively, causing valuable insights to remain buried in technical documents and unused codebases. This tutorial solves that problem by teaching you to create engaging, accessible web applications that bring your analysis to life.

## What We'll Cover

### Framework Landscape
