## Welcome to the Tutorial!

Transform your Python functions into interactive web applications and ensure your scientific work reaches the audience it deserves. In this hands-on session, you'll learn to bridge the gap between analysis and presentation using modern, open-source toolsâ€”all without leaving the Python ecosystem.

## What You'll Accomplish

By the end of this 4-hour tutorial, you will have:

- **Built and deployed** multiple interactive web applications
- **Created a personal app store/portfolio**
- **Gained practical experience** building and deploying web applications
- **Developed reproducible workflows** you can apply to future projects

I am a Data scientist at Lam Research with >6 years of experience in statistical data analysis, engineering, and machine learning. I've built and deployed over 50 web applications for my teams and colleagues at work, friends and family. I built Fast Dash, an open-source Python library that transforms Python functions into interactive web applications.
