::: {.callout-note}
You are highly encouraged to run these steps before the tutorial. 
We will also set aside some time during the tutorial to get everyone set up.
:::

During this tutorial, we'll use **Quarto** to aggregate our apps (app store) and **Google Cloud Run** to host them (optional). So, you will need to install Quarto and the `gcloud` CLI (optional). Google Cloud is only needed if you want to share your apps over the internet.

- **Install Quarto:**  
    Follow the instructions at [quarto.org/docs/get-started](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).

- **Install Google Cloud CLI (optional):**  
    Follow the instructions at [cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).

- **Install tutorial files and install Python environment:**
    Either install locally (recommended) or use Nebari (instructions to follow soon).


### Install Python enviornment locally (recommended)

We'll required Python 3.9+ for this tutorial. You can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. **Clone the Github repo and install dependencies**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dkedar7/show_your_work
```

2. **Install dependencies**

Open the repo with your favorite text editor, create a virtual environment and install dependencies.

```bash
cd show_your_work
python -m venv .venv

source .venv/bin/activate # For Linux and MacOS
.venv\Scripts\activate # For Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Launch Jupyter Lab to follow along**

```bash
jupyter lab
```

### Using Nebari (coming soon)

Nebari instructions

### Test your setup

Launch a new Jupyter notebook, and run the following cell

```python
from fast_dash import fastdash

@fastdash
def simple_app(text: str):
    output_text = "This is my first Fast Dash app!"
    return output_text
```
